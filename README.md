📧 Spam Email Detector (NLP & Data Science)

A practical spam email detection system built with a strong focus on:
 1.Data preprocessing
 2.Text cleaning 
 3.Feature engineering.  
The model classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** and is deployed as a simple **Streamlit web app**.

 🧩 What This Project Does
Spam emails create noise and risk. This project demonstrates how clean, well-prepared text data combined with machine learning can reliably detect spam in real time.


🧹 Data Preprocessing (Core Focus)
Professional text preprocessing pipeline implemented:
- Lowercasing and text normalization  
- Removal of punctuation, numbers, and special characters  
- Tokenization and whitespace cleaning  
- Handling missing and noisy text data  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Prepared clean, model-ready input for consistent predictions

This preprocessing significantly improves model performance and reliability.

 🤖 Modeling & Evaluation
- Algorithms: **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics  
- Final model serialized with `pickle` for deployment  

Achieved Accuracy: 89%

 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Streamlit
